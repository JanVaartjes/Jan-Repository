    "## Abstract\n",
    "One of the innovative projects within Inbiolab B.V. is called “Smart Jacket”. The Smart Jacket is a small and soft elastic jacket that will be used in the neonatal intensive care unit. The Smart Jacket offers electrocardiogram and respiration electromyography monitoring. A missing but important vital sign in the Smart Jacket concept is blood oxygen saturation. Existing devices are not energy efficient enough to work on the Smart Jacket’s battery. Inbiolab B.V. is therefore asking the question: can a pulse oximeter be included in the Smart Jacket concept? To answer this question, a project that is called: “development of an energy efficient pulse oximeter” has been started. All aspects of developing a pulse oximeter are discussed In this project.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most important differences with a conventional pulse oximeter is that the Smart Jacket will use a reflectance sensor instead of a transmittance sensor. This system is designed, implemented and tested together with an energy-efficient front-end integrated circuit. The testing phase was the most unpredictable. Based on an innovative technique, a new sensor was used on a different measuring site and with different settings than normal.\n",

    "In response to the question “Is it possible to include an pulse oximeter in the Smart Jacket concept?”, a  “yes” can be answered based on the tests that were undertaken and the promising results that were achieved. This conclusion is supported by the estimated theoretical maximum power consumption of 2,75 mW and an accuracy of 1,2 %.\n"

    "## Sensors used\n",
    "#### Electrocardiography\n",
    "To make an electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes are placed on the skin, which will then record the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. The depolarization of the heart during each heartbeat creates small electrical changes, which are measured by the electrodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Electromyography\n",
    "Electromyography (EMG) works in the same way as electrocardiography, using electrodes placed on the skin. The difference is that an EMG focuses on the electrical potential generated by muscle cells of the skeletal muscles when these are activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Oximetry\n",
    "Using oximetry one can measure a person's oxygen saturation. This can be done using two methods: transmissive pulse oximetry or reflectance pulse oximetry. The project from which the abstract was taken focuses on reflectance pulse oximetry, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflectance pulse oximetry may be used as an alternative to transmissive pulse oximetery described above. This method does not require a thin section of the person's body and is therefore well suited to a universal application such as the feet, forehead, and chest, but it also has some limitations. Vasodilation and pooling of venous blood in the head due to compromised venous return to the heart, as occurs with congenital cyanotic heart disease patients, or in patients in the Trendelenburg position, can cause a combination of arterial and venous pulsations in the forehead region and lead to spurious SpO2 results.[2]\n",
